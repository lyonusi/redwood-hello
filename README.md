# A JavaScript Blog Platform

This is a simple, functional blog platform created with RedwoodJS framework.

I created this project as I was applying for an unpaid position in a project team, and I was asked to demonstrate that I have the ability to learn fast when learning new frameworks and technologies.

Before this project I had zero knowledge of database ORM, GraphQL & Apollo, and serverless functions; it took me 3 days to learn these technologies and complete backend APIs for user signup, login, create/edit/delete blog posts, basic frontend interface, and successfully deploy this demo to Netlify.

Upon the completion of this project, I was accepted for the position. 

## Fun Fact ##
The most challenging part was not even the coding part.

On day one, I almost immediately failed to get it work in my local environment and NO useful information were given at all - I did not know what is not working, why is it happening, and how to make it work.

I actually read through 30+ source code documents of this framework and searched thoroughly on their community forum, GitHub pages, posted the issue, reached out for help, sent emails and messages to the contributors, and figured out there were some version conflicts with its included components and the co-founder replied with temporary solutions... and several small issues and bugs in the next couple of days, all solved in this way - and later on they were officially solved in the next published versions. 

And you know what? I very much enjoyed & appreciate this experience! 

I am now more confident to read source codes / documents, troubleshoot issues and bugs at a larger scale, and realize the empowerment of open source spirit at the very beginning of my career as a developer.
